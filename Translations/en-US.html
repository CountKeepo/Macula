This is a modification of the original Dracula Firefox theme based in the <a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula color palette</a>.

Modded Mac Dracula, aka Macula for Firefox

I originally used the amazing Dracula theme on Windows, but after swapping over to Mac I found the default Dracula theme a bit lacking.
So I went ahead and modified a version which better suited my needs.
